Chosen branch strategy: Git Flow

Justification: Git Flow can be adapted for testing by treating test-related changes similarly to code changes.
This will allow organized testing processes and ensure that test changes are properly integrated and tested before being merged into the main branch.

Strategy Description:
The repository holds two main branches:
1. main  – the official release history of the project
2. develop – the integration branch for features

Feature branches will be created for developing new tests or modifying existing ones.
Pull requests will be opened for these test branches, allowing for review and collaboration on test code.
Once tests are complete and passing, merge the test branches into the appropriate integration branch (develop)
